# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Marvin"
age = 30
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 7

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
name = "ALlyson"
age= 15
favorite_color= "yellow"
favorite_number= 21

print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"{name} and {favorite_color}")
#f"{name}""
#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
num1 =3
num2= 3
num3=int(input("what is your 3rd favorite")) # 5
num4=int( input("what is your 4th favroite")) # 4
print(num1 + num2) #ouput 6
print( num3 + num4) #output 54
#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
